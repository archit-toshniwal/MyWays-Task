Backend server is created in express minimal framework

Under this i have created multiple routes for users authentication to blogs crud tasks

for hashing and salting password i have used bcrypt and for authentication of user jwt is used

in this task i have tried to create mvc structure

*all db models are grouped in models folder

*all controller are grouped in controllers folder

i have also used middlewares like errorhandling,jwt token verification before any request proceed to blogs crud routes

*for security purpose all creditails are written inside .env file(Mongodb connection string,secret for jwt)
